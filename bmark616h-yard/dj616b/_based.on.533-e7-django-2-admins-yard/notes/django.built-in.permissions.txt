
Using django builtin permissions:

1.

http://192.168.88.60:6461/admin/auth/group/

SELECT *, rowid FROM "auth_group" LIMIT 50 (0.000 s) Edit

 Modify	id	name
 edit	1	staff

2.

http://192.168.88.60:6461/admin/auth/group/2/change/

for staff:
Chosen permissions 
blogapp | post | Can change post.  
blogapp | post | Can add post.  
blogapp | post | Can view post


3.

staff user:

is Staff
not Superuser
is in group: staff

4.

Front html app:
http://192.168.88.60:6461/blogapp/blogapp/Post/update/4/

Simple example here:

Regular user cannot edit post 
	- is not staff, so cannot django administration.
	- views.py update view: uses PermissionRequiredMixin, so it needs permission.  staff can 'blogapp.change_post'. Regular user cannot.
	
		class PostUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin,PermissionRequiredMixin,generic.UpdateView):
			permission_required = ('blogapp.change_post',  )

Typical usage:
	Regular user:
	Say Post is a main table for the app, so regular users can view,create,edit.
	Country table is a lookup table. Regular users can view only. This is so they can see countries in a select box for example.
	
	Staff user:
	can create,edit Country.
